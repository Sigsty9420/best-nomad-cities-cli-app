# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - CLI is working fine. ("ruby bin/best-nomad-cities")
- [x] Pull data from an external source - Initially my scraper handled this fine, but as of a few hours ago the website I was scraping changed, and is being changed constantly. I downloaded a copy of the page and saved it to my directory.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - You can see a list of cities, or see a specific city. Just follow the instructions.
