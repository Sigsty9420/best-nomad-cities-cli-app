# Best Nomad Cities

This Ruby App provides a CLI to view the top cities to live in for a "digital nomad" as per the wildly successful website, Nomadlist.com.

All credit for the data goes to Pieter Levels who started http://nomadlist.com

After a few days some changes took place on the NomadList homepage which broke the scraper, so I decided to scrape a local html backup I had made.

The CLI features a ranked list of cities. Individual cities can be selected or searched for to view a summary of relevant metrics.
